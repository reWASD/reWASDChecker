# reWASD checker

A straightforward tool for quickly checking some features using with reWASD. The request goes directly to the service and receives such flags:

* Some profile with turbo or combo (possible gaming benefits) is active
* Some profile with virtual gamepad is active
  * also mouse movement mapping is present or not present

If the reWASD version is below 7.1, some flags may not be supported, in which case it is assumed that feature could be used.

The source code can be fully adapted to suit individual needs.


## Requirements

* Visual Studio 2022
* reWASD 7.1 or higher
